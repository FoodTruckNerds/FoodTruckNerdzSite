# FoodTruckNerdz Website

This is the official homepage for the FoodTruckNerdz web implementation.

FoodTruckNerdz is a service to track food trucks and provide bookmarking to customers of those food trucks. Our companion App for Android and iOS allows food trucks to report their location with a Check-In and a background service that monitors their location during service hours.
